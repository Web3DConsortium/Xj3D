These are release notes for Xj3D from M1 forward.  Each release will
detail its functionality in meeting the applicable specifications and document
any known issues.  If a feature works differently based on an encoding (utf8 or
XML) it will be noted.

Release: 2.1(May 22, 2014)
-------------------------
Major changes since 2.0-RC1:

  Due to many improvements and bug fixes during this reporting cycle, NPS
  MOVES feels v2.1 is warranted over 2.0 since it has been almost 4 years since
  a release was offered.

  Upgraded Aviatrix3D to JOGL v2.1.  This is a major update to Aviatrix3D in
  which we are now leveraging JOGL's Native Windowing Tookkit (NEWT) to render
  the 3D pipeline which has the advantage of offering a way to decouple from the
  AWT/Swing EDT model.  This capability paves the way towards much more
  efficient multi-threaded rendering. Simple explanation here:
  https://sites.google.com/site/justinscsstuff/jogl-tutorial-2.  Xj3D defaults
  to NEWT unless specified to use one of the swing-lightweight (GLJPanel), or
  swing (GLCanvas) modes..

  Jogamp has also implemented Automated Native Library Loading:
  http://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/userguide/#automatednativelibraryloading

  Implemented the Arc2D on the OGL and NR render packages.  Still
  need to implement the SAI node

  Fixed issue in the CadFilter for the DefaultRigidBodyPhysicsManager which
  must be initialized by the CadFilter startup process, else an
  UnsatisfiedLinkError was thrown

  BrowserConfig defaults are now set to highest levels for (AA, AAQ, TQ, and PQ)

  Fixed bug in org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.BaseGroupingNode when an
  incorrect type VRMLGroupNodeType vice VRMLBoundedNodeType was used to render
  a .wrl type proto example

  Addressed fix for NPE when employing the replica (headless) screen capture app
  for capturing screen shots of scripted scenes ensuring building the script
  engines a Replica app startup.

  Fixed issue where hardcoded values were passed for anti-aliasing vice letting
  JOGL tell us what the maximum number of available FSAA samples are via its
  GLCapabilities improvements

  Incorporated Vince Marchetti's contributions who improved the jgeom lib for
  mesh and NURBS operations.

  Corrected issue in org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.input.dis.DISConnectionHandler
  where the BehaviorProducerUDP thread in OpenDIS was not daemon which prevented
  the JVM from shutting down.

  Bugfix 615

  Fixed a usability issue with old inlined viewpoints not being removed when a
  new inline is dynamically inserted. XMSF Bugs 439 and 1317 pertain.  The fix was
  implemented in:
  http://svn.xj3d.org/xj3d_code/branches/NPS/org/xj3d/impl/core/eventmodel/DefaultFrameStateManager.java

  Bugfixes 300, 506, 601, 615, 640

Release: M10(February 16, 2005)
-------------------------------
Major changes since M9:

  Installers added for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.

  Aviatrix3D now the default renderer. 2X speed increase.

  X3D spec conformance now much more strict. Enforces the profile and
  component statements, spec version mixing, DEF/USE semantics, scripting
  language changes and more. If your old files don't run anymore, this is
  most likely the cause. Check the console for the error message of what
  you've done wrong.

  Immersive profile node support complete. Some fields and behaviour
  are still incomplete.

  Switched to JInput for input device handling. Allows the use of
  various alternate input devices like gamepads, joysicks etc. Mac version
  disabled for this release due to bugs in JInput.

  Spatialised audio added for Aviatrix3D renderer

  CADInterchange profile and related components added

  Initial GeoSpatial component added

  Initial DIS component added

  H-Anim component implementation.  Software and hardware shader versions.
  Hardware shaders disabled by default due to high hardware requirements
  (Only runs on nVidia 6800 GTO cards).

  New Text implementation using geometry instead of textures for Aviatrix3D

  Multiwall and stereo support added. Elumens Dome support now standard

  Viewpoint lists now populated from inlines

  creaseAngle handing much faster (10x) for dynamic IndexedFaceSets

  Rigid Body Physics extension component added

  Particle Systems extension component updated

  Clipping Planes extension component added

  Picking Utilities extension component added

  Abstract Device I/O extension component added (replaces the old Midi
  component with a much more generic representation for all input device
  types)

  Mostly untested version of vrml.eai.BrowserFactory.createComponent(host,port)
  added.

  Added some support for configuration of the EAI and SAI browser components
  using property files and parameters to create*Component.

See the following page for which nodes are implemented:

http://www.xj3d.org/status.html

And this page contains documentation of all the extension components added
to Xj3D.

http://www.xj3d.org/extensions/


Release: M8(December 10, 2003)
-------------------------
Major changes since M7:

  SAI implementation
     Java Issues:
        some event model timing restrictions are incorrectly blocked.
     ECMAScript:
        rootNodes property of browser not implemented

  Complete new input device handling implementation. Now completely generic
      allowing anything from a mouse to joystick, to glove, to HMD to interact
      with the scene. Mouse and keyboard nav is provided.

  Elumens Dome/VisionStation support complete for the Java3D renderer.
      (note requires installation of DLLs etc. Has a completely separate
      installer and not part of the standard downloads).

  Added new experimental application for doing file format conversions. Look
      into the apps/converter directory. This will allow you to convert between
      any of the encodings as well as X3D <-> VRML97.  Still very much a beta release right now.
      Known issues with directOutput flag on scripts.

  IndexedFaceSet: A lot of work going into the triangulation routines. Made
      more efficient and sorted out a number of bugs to do with normal
      generation and ccw handling.

  Major rework of how textures are handled in the system
  	Multitextures should now reliably load.
  	Updated Multitexture to final specification.
  	Experimental TextureProperties node available.

  Lines and Points now use the emissive color for lighting.

  TextureTransform fixed for scale/translation combinations.

  Fixed bug preventing XML files from being used as the target for Inlines.

  Fixed bug where Java scripts were not loading in XML files due to incorrect
      attribute handling.

  Initial implementation of DragSensors. They mainly work, but there's still
      a few bugs around dealing with autoOffset/offset.

  Basic NURBs nodes implementation. This is according to the original X3D ISO
      spec document. In the final version, it is dramatically different, so use
      at your own risk!

  Fog is back functional again.

  Background nodes fully functional.

  apps/Xj3DBrowser is starting to look much more like a real browser now.
    Cursor Shapes (including ability to custom defined them) is now provided
        within the infrastructure. These are used anywhere that Xj3D provides a
        canvas or higher abstraction of the viewing process. Setup immediately
        for the SAI/EAI and Xj3DBrowser in the apps directory.

    Files now correctly obey the file extensions when using the URL interface.
        For X3D VRML-encoded files, you now _must_ have the .x3dv file extension.
        The old .wrl file extension shall be only interpreted to mean VRML97
        files. We also have the new mime-types handled too, but there's no
        content being served up from webservers using the new extension yet.

  Billboard now functions correctly.

  Last of the createVrmlFromUrl architecture updates are debugged. The entire
      event model should work as advertised in the VRML97 spec now.

  Anchors now pass conformance tests.  A few bugs fixed in this process.

  Dot product fixed ecmascript VrmlMatrix

  Initial binding of bindables now spec compliant.  Scripts which bind bindables
  during initialize will work right.

  Blank viewpoints not added to viewpoint list as spec recommendation

  Bug 58 fixed.  JavascriptScriptWrapper doesn't set the error reporter on the Context object
  before invoking the initialize method.

  Bug 31 and 53 fixed.  Not getting all vrmlEvents using VrmlEventListener

  Tilt navigation restored to browser.

  Reload should work better in the browser.  World reloads are synched to the event model.

  Bug 19 fixed.  Routes need to type check

  Lots of PROTO related issues fixed.

  MIDI input now available.  See the xj3d_sound component.

  Parsing speed improvements for large sets of MF* fields. Anywhere from 20% to
      70% faster.

  EventUtilities debugging. Everything should be working as advertised now.

  IndexedTriangleSet, TriangleSet nodes implemented.


Release: M7(March 05, 2003)
-------------------------
Major changes since M6:

Navigation fix to stop mouse stutter
XML support for final ISO doctype, SF/MFString handling and meta tags.
Block comments support in the VRML Classic Encoding
Transparency fix for multiple transparent objects.
Experimental Sound and Movie Texture.  Requires Java3D 1.3.1 beta.
Initial drag sensor support.
Touch Sensors on Cylinders fixed.

These are release notes for Xj3D for M7.  If a feature works differently based
on an encoding(utf8 or XML) it will be noted.

Release: M6(January 03 , 2003)
-------------------------
Major changes since M5:
    XML Parsing now a first class supported operation and handled seamlessly.
	    Supports the latest spec release and further development work past
	    current published spec. See the X3d-3.0.dtd file for the required
	    document structure. Required some major restructuring of the parsing
   	    code including lots of package shuffling.

    Complete rewrite of all of the event model evaluation code. It is now
  	    fully specification compliant. It is also much more efficient and
	    generally renderer-independent. The only time it dips into renderer
	    dependent code is for navigation and view-dependent actions.
	    (ie sensors) No garbage generated and only updates all objects once
	    per frame rather than after every eventIn received.

    ECMAScript constructors now validated to work correctly. Had to rework a
        lot of code in the builtin object representation to do this because of
        limitations in the Rhino capabilities (and complete abscence of docs)

    EXTERNPROTO debugging. Almost every gnarly example of PROTO/EXTERNPROTO that
        we could find on the 'net works. We've run across quite a few doing dodgy
        stuff such as cyclic DEF/USE constructs that are illegal in VRML that
        some other browsers support.  There is one hard-to-reproduce timing
        oriented bug left that we haven't fixed yet. About one in ten tries of
        using heavily nested externprotos will cause one not to show, but
        without crashes or any other indicator.

    Full runtime support for an in-memory VRML scene with no rendered output.
	   Not all works yet, no navigation or any sensors, just basics.

    ProximitySensors now support position_changed and orientation_changed

    VisibilitySensors more accurate about when they are detected

    Protos and Externprotos coming and going from the scene graph work correctly
	  for the inclusion of sensors and bindables.

    Hex encoding of integer values works for all SF/MFInt32 fields.

    MultiTexturing. Modified version of the Blaxxun proposal but more VRML-like.

    LOD is back functional again.

    Added support for MFImage and SF/MFColorRGBA. New field types defined by
        the X3D spec.

    Support for centerOfRotation field in X3D Viewpoint.  EXAMINE mode now sets
    the orientation to look at this point and orbit around it.


These are release notes for Xj3D for M6.  If a feature works differently based
on an encoding(utf8 or XML) it will be noted.

The following VRML concepts work:
    parsing(utf8 and XML)
        If the last line of the file is a comment the parser generates an error
        Supports #* *# as a block comment character which has been changed to #/* */# in the spec.
    DEF/USE(utf8 and XML)
	PROFILE and COMPONENT(UTF8 nad XML)
	    Profile and components definitions follow the ISO spec
	IMPORT/EXPORT (utf8)
	    Keywords are supported and exports work. Imports do not, but don't
		crash or issue an error either (silent fail)
    Routing(utf8 and XML)
    Scripting(utf8)
        JSAI(Java) supported
        ECMAScript supported
            Except - SFNode constructor with a string (eg new SFNode('Group[]');
                   - VrmlMatrix implemented, not tested.Obscure setTransform
                     stuff partially implemented (missing shear handling)
        External (EAI 2.0) supported
    Prototypes(utf8)
        EXTERNPROTO as the first node not supported
    Extern prototypes (utf8)
    URN Resolution - Local resolution works, but you need to setup the application
        to specify the correct installation path.  See DIYBrowser for an example.
    GeoVRML support
        GeoInline, GeoElevationGrid, GeoPositionInterpolator tested
        Spec issues with GeoViewpoint
    UMEL Support
        Works, need to setup installation path. See DIYBrowser for an example.
    LatticeXVL
	    Works in general. May have broken something since M4, but that's more a
		general proto issue.

The following nodes work:
    Anchor
    Appearance
    Box
    Color
    ColorInterpolator
    Cone
    Coordinate
    CoordinateInterpolator
    Cylinder
    DirectionalLight
    ElevationGrid
    Extrusion
    FontStyle
    Group
    ImageTexture
    IndexedFaceSet
    IndexedLineSet
        Lighting uses diffuseColor instead of emissiveColor
    Inline
    LoadSensor
    KeySensor
    LOD
    Material
        Look at turning lighting off for emissive only decls
    NavigationInfo
    Normal
    NormalInterpolator
    OrientationInterpolator
    PixelTexture
    PointLight
    PointSet
        Lighting uses diffuseColor instead of emissiveColor
    PositionInterpolator
    ScalarInterpolator
    Script
    Shape
    Sphere
    SpotLight
    StaticGroup
    Switch
    TextureCoordinate
    TextureTransform
    TimeSensor
    Transform
    Viewpoint
    WorldInfo

The following nodes have some implementation but are not finished:
    AudioClip
	Should work with 1.3.1 beta is released.  Otherwise a null sound warning is generated.
    Background
	    Textures work, no sky or ground colors.
    Billboard
	    Functions as grouping node only, no movement to face viewer.
    Collision
        Proxy not supported
    Fog
    	Needs to be patched into the new bindable handling.
    Text
  	Does not handle vertical rendering, horizontal only.  Sizing still looks weird.
    Sound
    TouchSensor
        Does not support hitNormal and hitTexCoord changed events. hitPoint is
  	    OK. isOver may need a little further testing, but should be generally
	    reliable.

The following VRML97 nodes are not implemented:
    CylinderSensor
    MovieTexture
    PlaneSensor
    SphereSensor

Specific Issues with example programs:
    browser
        Reloading a file with multiple inlines using the same URL but not DEFed
            will cause a multi_parent exception. Switching to a
            SimpleLoadManager instead of a MemCacheLoadManager will resolve.
        GeoVRML and UMEL local resolution not supported in pre-compiled code,
            you need to specify the local installation path in DIYBrowser.java
            and recompile.

    loader
        Works as advertised

X3D specification Notes:

SAI interfaces are provided but no implementation is yet available.

Custom Xj3D Extensions:

Surfaces/Overlays: Component named xj3d_overlay is available. A sort-of
surfaces proposal, but has about 50% commonality. There as a strawman,
but works completely. Expect the nodes to change over time, so don't get
too accustomed to it. Node specs are available on the xj3d.org website.

Particle systems. Component named xj3d_particles. No relation to the
Blaxxun proposal as that is way too limiting. Some implementation notes
available on xj3d.org. Not tested yet and only runs for the Java3D renderer.

Release: M5(July 12, 2002)
-------------------------
Major changes since M4:
	IMPORT/EXPORT parsed but doesn't work
	Texture Improvements:
		GIF support
		faster texture loading
		rescaling looks better
	Fixed ProximitySensor problem with 0,0,10 viewpoints
	J3D Loader Capability Bits specification
	New Nodes:
		Static Group
		VisibilitySensor
		LoadSensor
		Overlay
	OGL initial implementation
	Collision
		Collide = FALSE now supported
	TouchSensor
		now uses exact geometry instead of just bounds
	DirectionalLight
		Fixed incorrect ambient intensity default, was 0.2 now 0
	Viewpoint
		Fixed a bug where the viewpoint was wrong occasionally
	TextureCache
		Textures are cached by URL.  This will catch most textures that have
		the same URL but not USEd.

These are release notes for Xj3D for M5.  If a feature works differently based
on an encoding(utf8 or XML) it will be noted.

The following VRML concepts work:
    parsing(utf8 and XML)
        If the last line of the file is a comment the parser generates an error
    DEF/USE(utf8 and XML)
	PROFILE and COMPONENT(UTF8)
	    Profile and components definitions follow the Siggraph 2002 draft spec
	IMPORT/EXPORT (utf8)
	    Keywords are supported and exports work. Imports do not, but don't
		crash or issue an error either (silent fail)
    routing(utf8 and XML)
    Scripting(utf8)
        JSAI(Java) supported
        ECMAScript supported
            Except - SFNode constructor with a string (eg new SFNode('Group[]');
                   - VrmlMatrix implemented, not tested.Obscure setTransform
                     stuff partially implemented (missing shear handling)
        External (EAI 2.0) supported
            begin/endUpdate, implemented, not fully supported
    Prototypes(utf8)
        Proto's cannot emulate sensors currently
        EXTERNPROTO as the first node not supported
    Extern prototypes (utf8)
        Those containing bindables that are not the first node do not work
        correctly for those nodes ie Viewpoint, NavigationInfo, BackGround, Fog
    URN Resolution - Local resolution works, but you need to setup the application
        to specify the correct installation path.  See DIYBrowser for an example.
    GeoVRML support
        GeoInline, GeoElevationGrid, GeoPositionInterpolator tested
        Spec issues with GeoViewpoint
    UMEL Support
        Works, need to setup installation path. See DIYBrowser for an example.

        Lighting uses diffuseColor instead of emissiveColor
    Inline
    LoadSensor
    LOD
        Gone backwards slightly from M3. Can't be USEd in a renderable node
        parent. OK to USE with scripts. Java3D's Behaviours cannot be under a
        SharedGroup, so this has been removed pending a *major* redesign of all
        our dynamic behaviours system in M6.
    Material

    WorldInfo

The following nodes have some implementation but are not finished:
    Background
	Field handling done, but no rendering.
    KeySensor
	Mostly done but not hooked up to the event delivery mechanism.
    ProximitySensor
        Does not support position_changed or orientation_changed Cannot be
        used under a DEF scene graph due to Java3D behaviour limitations. All
        parent nodes to the root of the world must be non-DEF.
    SpotLight
        Not really complete.  Works mostly as a Point light
        BeamWidth is currently ignored.  Need to convert to spreadAngle
        radius is currently ignored.  Need to convert to spreadAngle
    Text
	Field handling done, but no rendering.
    TouchSensor
        Does not support hitNormal and hitTexCoord changed events. hitNormal is
	OK. isOver may need a little further testing, but should be generally
	reliable.
    Collision
        Proxy not supported
    VisibilitySensor
        Union of USE regions not handled correctly

The following VRML97 nodes are not implemented:
    AudioClip
    Billboard
    CylinderSensor
    Extrusion
    MovieTexture
    NormalInterpolator
    PlaneSensor
    Sound
    SphereSensor

Specific Issues with example programs:
    browser
        Reloading a file with multiple inlines using the same URL but not DEFed
            will cause a multi_parent exception. Switching to a
            SimpleLoadManager instead of a MemCacheLoadManager will resolve.
        GeoVRML and UMEL local resolution not supported in pre-compiled code,
            you need to specify the local installation path in DIYBrowser.java
            and recompile.

    DOMViewer
        Does not support scripts or protos in XML documents.
        Since it sets every field of a node it can uncover bugs that DIYBrowser
        won't.

    editor
        Really basic right now, not much testing done
        Using nodes whichs contain urls will not work for http references,
            causes an exception.

    loader
        Undergoing some major surgery currently.

    SAI_DOM_Demo
        Nonfunctional as of M3 release.

X3D specification Notes:

We are tracking behind the SAI release.  The currently provided SAI system
works but is not current.

XML part temporarily disabled from the build process while we work on the SAI
proposal. The nodes there clash with our proposal and we suspect that the
whole lot will disappear or be replaced with something much simpler.

Custom Xj3D Extensions:

A new component called Xj3D_Overlay is available. A sort-of surfaces proposal,
but has about 50% commonality. There as a strawman, but works completely.
Expect the nodes to change over time, so don't get too accustomed to it.
Node specs are available on the xj3d.org website.

Release: M4(Feb 19, 2002)
-------------------------
The following VRML concepts work:
    parsing(utf8 and XML)
    DEF/USE(utf8 and XML)
    routing(utf8 and XML)
    Scripting(utf8)
        JSAI(Java) supported
            Except ReplaceWorld
		ECMAScript supported
            Except - ReplaceWorld
			       - SFNode constructor with a string (eg new SFNode('Group[]');
				   - VrmlMatrix implemented, not tested.Obscure setTransform
				     stuff partially implemented (missing shear handling)
        External (EAI 2.0) supported
            replaceWorld not yet supported
            begin/endUpdate, implemented, not fully supported
    Prototypes(utf8)
        Proto's cannot emulate sensors currently
	Extern prototypes (utf8)
        Those containing bindables do not work correctly for those nodes
            ie Viewpoint, NavigationInfo, BackGround, Fog

The following nodes work:
    Appearance
    Box
    Color
    ColorInterpolator
    Cone
    Coordinate
    CoordinateInterpolator
    Cylinder
    DirectionalLight
    ElevationGrid
    Fog
    Group
    ImageTexture
        Scaling images looks awful.  Recommend you prescale content to power 2.
        If an image is not USEd it will be reloaded from disk everytime
        Known issues with transparency.
        No support for GIF's
    IndexedFaceSet
    IndexedLineSet
        Lighting uses diffuseColor instead of emissiveColor
    Inline
    LOD
	    Gone backwards slightly from M3. Can't be USEd in a renderable node
		parent. OK to USE with scripts. Java3D's Behaviours cannot be under a
		SharedGroup, so this has been removed pending a *major* redesign of all
		our dynamic behaviours system in M5.
    Material
        Look at turning lighting off for emissive only decls
    NavigationInfo
    Normal
    OrientationInterpolator
    PixelTexture

    Sphere
    Switch

The following nodes have some implementation but are not finished:
    Anchor
    Background
    KeySensor
    ProximitySensor
        Does not support position_changed or orientation_changed
        Incorrectly tests for all viewpoints instead of just moving.  So a PS
        which encompasses 0,0,10(default VP) will always be activated. Cannot be
		used under a DEF scene graph due to Java3D behaviour limitations. All
		parent nodes to the root of the world must be non-DEF.
