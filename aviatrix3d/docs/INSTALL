                 Compiling and Installation Guide

Aviatrix3D is a pure retained-mode Java scene graph API over the top of Java
OpenGL bindings (JSR 231) and OpenAL Java bindings (for spatialised audio
support). It supports lightweight and heavyweight rendering in both AWT, Swing
and Native Windowing Toolkit (NEWT) environments.

External Downloads
-------------------

The following libraries are required:

J2SE (Java development environment)

What:
Version: 1.8.0 or later

JOGL (Java OpenGL Bindings)

Where: Where: http://jogamp.org/
Version: 2.4 (or better)

JOAL (Java OpenAL Bindings)

Build Environment
------------------

The code is built around a standard Apache Ant environment.

You can of course compile the codebase by CLI, or via an IDE that supports Ant.

When installing the native code libraries required above, we recommend that you
do not place them into your JRE lib/ext directory. Instead, place them
somewhere common that all users can get to, but where different versions of
the same toolkit can co-exist depending on your runtime needs.
